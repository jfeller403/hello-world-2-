my first repository

I am a mathematician trying to learn how to code so that I can move on to a better job. I have a Ph.D. My area of study was discrete time dynamical systems. Ever heard of the Mandelbrat set and Julia sets? That is what I studied.

I have a lot of experience with LaTex and have had a semester long course learning to code in Java. I helped my GF with FORTRAN and I am currently learning python and SQL.
